## New Year's Resolution

A new year, a new website, and an opportunity to finally get round to this blogging thing I keep hearing about!

While my intention is (first and foremost) to use this blog to enhance my writing, by forcing me into a more regular routine, there is another personal goal for 2021 that I hope this blog can support.

Like most areas of applied philosophy and ethics, having practical experience of the target domain (e.g. politics, medicine, data science) helps you uncover subtleties and nuances that others may spot, while also having a greater appreciation for the challenges that arise in different fields and disciplines. During my PhD, I found that engaging with psychologists, neuroscientists, anthropologists, and roboticists, to be not only intellectually rewarding, but also greatly improved my own research in Philosophy of Cognitive Science.

Now, while I do not believe that philosophy should be the handmaiden on the sciences, I do think it is vital for philosophers and ethicists working in relevant areas (e.g. ethics of AI) to have a solid theoretical and (ideally) practical understanding of their respective target discipline. Over the last several years, I have been fortunate enough to work alongside scientists in _genuinely_ interdisciplinary organisations (e.g. Oxford Internet Institute, Alan Turing Institute) and have also had the opportunity to work in the computer science department at the University of Bristol. These opportunities have enabled me to benefit from the knowledge and experience of a diverse range of fantastic sciences, making it significantly easier to improve my theoretical understanding—first in cognitive neuroscience and, more recently, in machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, while I was comfortable in "interdisciplinary environments" I rarely got my hands dirty with the practical side of the cognitive sciences (e.g. performing a neuroimaging study, programming a self-learning robotic system).

With this in mind I have decided that for 2021 I am going to get more _hands on_ with data science and machine learning.

## The Plan

At present, my research interest is focused at the intersection of *data ethics*, *human-computer interaction*, and *responsible research and innovation* (in data science, machine learning, and AI). In short, [my role within the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/christopher-burr) is to work with policy makers and stakeholders to ensure that technologies such as ML or AI promote social good. This requires careful reflection on the operationalisation of ethical principles such as sustainability, accountability, fairness, and explainability—or, what I term the "SAFE principles"—and their practical implementation within the everyday practices of technological research and innovation.

My plan for 2021 is to teach myself the necessary technical skills (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, formal methods) to be able to _actively contribute_ (in both a theoretical and practical manner) to the disciplines that my research engages with. Initially I will be focusing on fairness and explainability, as these have a more direct practical orientation. However, I will say more about the specifics as this blog develops (e.g., specific goals). For now, I will just note that I will be documenting my progress and journey in the hope that others from varying disciplines may find my notes useful. For example, I am going to record and document what learning resources, tools and software packages I will be using, while also pointing out areas that I did not find useful. I will also develop a curated bibliography of the resources that I will be using to help me on this journey—more on this in the next blog post. This will also serve as a record for my own benefit, to see what progress (if any) has been made.

## My Background

It is important to note that I am not starting this journey from scratch. I have been working in this field for some time now. As such, I have a decent theoretical conceptual understanding of probability theory, statistical learning theory, and machine learning. I also work at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk)—the UK's national research institute for data science and AI, so I have the benefit of working alongside some of the world's best data scientists who I can turn to when I need guidance.

Despite this background, I am going to try to approach this exercise with fresh eyes, returning to some of the basics in order to firm up my practical and theoretical foundations. While I have a decent *conceptual* grasp of programming and development, the practical side of my knowledge and understanding is patchy. For instance, I am comfortable with typesetting tools such as LaTeX, web development languages such as HTML, have some basic understanding of Python, and I can stumble my way around a CLI using resources such as Stack Overflow when I come up against a roadblock.

## Get in Touch

I enjoy working with and alongside others. If there are any parts of this project that interest you, please get in touch using your preferred contact method over on the left :point_left:.

I would be particularly interested in hearing about ways to make the communication of this research more accessible. An early focus will be on web development tools and standards that support inclusivity and accessibility. The superb [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) community have already published a lot of material on this that I intend to delve into and hopefully support. For the time being, however, I am sticking to [HUGO](https://gohugo.io)—a (highly recommended) static site generator—to allow me to get up-to-speed quicker.

Alternatively, if you just want to be kept up-to-date, please follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrisdburr) to be notified when new posts and resources are published. My intention is to release a new post once a fortnight (at a minimum) initially, and then increase this to weekly (and maybe more frequently).
