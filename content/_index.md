# Who am I?

Although I am a philosopher of cognitive science, I'll resist the temptation to answer this question with a philosophical digression about the nature of consciousness, selfhood, or personal identity.

I am currently an Ethics Fellow the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/christopher-burr), where I work alongside fantastic and friendly colleagues as part of the Public Policy Programme. I am also a Research Associate at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, where I was previously a member of the Digital Ethics Lab and am still a research affiliate of the [Wellbeing Research Centre](https://wellbeing.hmc.ox.ac.uk/home).

Broadly, my research focuses on digital ethics (e.g. data ethics, ethics of AI), human-computer interaction, and the overlap between emerging technologies and public policy. More specifically, my research interests include topics in bioethics (e.g. how AI technologies should be used to support or deliver mental healthcare), cognitive science (e.g. how to understand the risks of intelligent systems influencing and shaping human judgement and choice behaviour), the study of well-being (e.g. how can we use digital technologies to measure and promote individual and social well-being), and human-computer interaction (e.g. how to design intelligent systems that promote intentional use and self-determination).

Please see [here](cv) for a list of publications and links to articles.

I am also a co-organiser of the Special Interest Group at the Alan Turing Institute, '[Facilitating Responsible Participation in Data Science](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/facilitating-responsible-participation-data-science)'.

Prior to joining the Alan Turing Institute, I worked at the Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol where I explored the ethical and epistemological impact of big data and artificial intelligence as part of the thinkBIG project. I also worked at the Department of Philosophy, University of Bristol, where I completed my PhD in 2017.

My research has been featured in the media, including BBC Radio 4, the New York Times and Vox. I have also advised policy makers and worked with the Ministry of Justice, Office for Artificial Intelligence, Information Commissioner's Office, Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and the Department of Health and Social Care.
