## The Problem

- Research waste, competing work/life pressures, impact and assesment metrics, we all know the drill.
- However, I got into professional and academic research because I found the process of discovering, researching, discussing, refining, and communicating ideas to be an intrinsically rewarding process. Research tools are supposed to support this process. Those who work in UX design recognise that such tools are interfaces for the transfer of information. Or, to take a more phenomenological perspective, tools for interacting with our physical environment. The tools, therefore, should support and enhance our interaction with information. Those that place a cognitive burden on the user, and fail to integrate and complement their existing cognitive processes are failing at their job.
- Over the last couple of years I have been slowly refining my research workflow by replacing various tools to better support several interconnected goals. These goals can be summarised as follows:
    - The process of research and writing should feel as **rewarding** as knowledge discovery.
    - The communication of ideas should be **clear and purposeful**.
    - My workflow should not present barriers to collaboration and should **promote participation**.

## The Solution

- The following is, admittedly, a masterclass in productination.

> productination
[proh-duhk-tuh-ney-shuhn]
*noun*

1 the action of delaying or postponing something important, often because it is unpleasant or boring, in favour of something that is less unpleasant but, nevertheless, useful
2 a neologism and portmanteauâ€”the combination of productive and procrastination
