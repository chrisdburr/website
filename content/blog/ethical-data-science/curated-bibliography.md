# Outline

- Keeping track of resources
    - As I learn more about the practical challenges of ethical data science I want to keep track of those resources that I found useful, and which I hope will prove beneficial for others.
    - However, thinking ahead, I would also like this to result in a publicly available resource that is more than just a series of blog posts or a list of references.
- A Curated Bibliography
    - The goal I have in mind is to develop a bibliography that is both searchable and informative. In other words, as part of this journey I will aim to build an interactive and curated bibliography of resources for those interested in ethical data science as well as the cluster of wider disciplines that fall within the broad domain of responsible research and innovation.
    - Each entry should contain (at a minimum) the following:
        - Title & Author
        - Bibliographic Information (e.g. Publication, Year, DOI)
        - Keywords or Categories
            - There are a few options for how to handle this, as many entries (e.g. journal articles) are likely to have their own author-defined keywords. However, my hope is that as the curated bibliography develops, there will emerge something of a natural taxonomy for the resources. I have something akin to the fantastic [PhilPapers database](https://philpapers.org) in mind here.
        - Summary
            - This should be more than just an abstract. It should help the reader to decide whether it is worth investing time in reading the article. Obviously, the summary will reflect certain personal biases, but this is somewhat unavoidable when *curating* any repository or set of resources.
        - Link to original article or preprint (where available)
            - Ideally, I would like to ensure as many individuals possible are able to benefit from this bibliography, regardless of whether they have a University subscription for journal articles or conference proceedings. Therefore, I will try to prioritise freely available resources or those that are open access. However, if I find that a resource is particularly useful, but is behind a paywall I will note this.
- Goals
    - What do I want to achieve with this? There are two goals I have in mind.
        - Firstly, I would like to keep track of those resources that I found useful for my own benefit. I have been a long-term user of citation managers such as Papers and Zotero. However, these programs are typically designed for academic usage (e.g. automatically building bibliographies). Therefore, while they suit my own purpose, their sharing options are somewhat limited. In my job I am often required to teach, instruct, or train others. Where this requires compiling a set of resources that can be used for self-directed learning, it is often inappropriate to just hand the students a long list of references. Therefore...
        - Secondly, I would like to develop a tool that others can make use of for developing their own reading lists, curricula, or satiating their intellectual curiosity.
- Provisional Plan
    - Speak with Dan about how best to integrate this into a personal blog.
